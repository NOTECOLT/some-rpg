# SOME RPG (Name Pending)
Yeah, so I should probably make a README for this now.

This project uses:
- [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html)
- [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
- [TiledCS](https://github.com/TheBoneJarmer/TiledCS)

## Goal / Vision
The plan is to create a small bite-sized JRPG-type game. A la Pokemon, Zelda, Final Fantasy, and other classic JRPG/Adventure games.\
Possible points of interest:
- Filipino / Fantasy - infused aesthetic & world
- Turn-based combat

A single main quest line with a boss at the end will do, perhaps with a single small dungeon.
I'll make a GDD once I get around to actual conceptualization.
